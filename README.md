# The implementation of the SQL and BPMN leaks-when analysis tools for pleak.io.

## Requirements

For both analysis tools:

- Z3 Theorem Prover - to install, you can clone it from [https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3) and compile it yourself or (on some Linux versions, for example Ubuntu) execute `apt install z3`. You will need Z3 to be in the PATH.
- opam (`apt install opam`)
- ocaml (`apt install ocaml`) - version 4.02.0 is needed (`opam switch 4.02.0`)
- ocamlgraph (`opam install ocamlgraph` / `apt install libocamlgraph-ocaml-dev`)
- xml-light (`opam install xml-light` / `apt install libxml-light-ocaml-dev`)
- Yojson (`opam install Yojson`)

Based on environment, you might also need to install:

- m4 (`apt install m4`)
- ocamlfind (`opam install ocamlfind`)

## Installing & building

For the SQL leaks-when analysis tool:

Read Installing & building instructions in [pleak-leaks-when-ast-transformation](https://github.com/pleak-tools/pleak-leaks-when-ast-transformation) repository.

For the BPMN leaks-when analysis tool:

Execute `ocamlbuild -use-ocamlfind GrbDriver.native` in \src directory.

Making a query compatible with Guessing Advantage analysis and sql contraint propagation:

Execute `ocamlbuild -use-ocamlfind GrbToGA.native` in \src directory.
Run `./GrbToGA.native outfilepath [target_object]` to convert the workflow up to tagret_object (convert everything if it is not specified) and write the result to file located at 'outfilepath'. The input SQL worklof is read from RAInput.ml, which is generated by another component (see [pleak-leaks-when-ast-transformation](https://github.com/pleak-tools/pleak-leaks-when-ast-transformation)).

## Using

You can use both analysers through [Pleak PE-BPMN & Leaks-When editor](https://github.com/pleak-tools/pleak-pe-bpmn-editor).
